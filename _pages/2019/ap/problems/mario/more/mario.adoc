= Problem: Mario

== tl;dr

Implement a program that prints out a double half-pyramid of a specified height, per the below.

[source,subs="macros,quotes"]
----
$ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#4#
   pass:[#  #]
  pass:[##  ##]
 pass:[###  ###]
pass:[####  ####]
----

== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along three axes primarily.

Correctness::
  To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?

Design::
  To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?

Style::
  To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

To obtain a passing grade in this course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless granted an exception in writing by the instructor.

== Background

Toward the beginning of World 1-1 in Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers, Mario must hop over two "half-pyramids" of blocks as he heads toward a flag pole.  Below is a screenshot.

== Specification

* Write, in a file called `mario.c` in your `~/unit1/mario/` directory, a program that recreates these half-pyramids using hashes (`#`) for blocks.
* The program we'll write will be called `mario`. And let's allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramids should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive. 
* If the user doesn't, in fact, input a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive, when prompted, the program should re-prompt the user until they cooperate.
* Then, generate (with the help of `printf` and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid.

== Usage

Your program should behave per the example below. Assumed that the underlined text is what some user has typed.

[source,subs="macros,quotes"]
----
$ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#4#
   pass:[#  #]
  pass:[##  ##]
 pass:[###  ###]
pass:[####  ####]
----

[source,subs="macros,quotes"]
----
$ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#0#
----

[source,subs="macros,quotes"]
----
$ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#-5#
Height: [underline]#4#
   pass:[#  #]
  pass:[##  ##]
 pass:[###  ###]
pass:[####  ####]
----

[source,subs="macros,quotes"]
----
$ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#-5#
Height: [underline]#five#
Retry: [underline]#40#
Height: [underline]#24#
Height: [underline]#4#
   pass:[#  #]
  pass:[##  ##]
 pass:[###  ###]
pass:[####  ####]
----

Notice that width of the "gap" between adjacent pyramids is equal to the width of two hashes, irrespective of the pyramids' heights.

Modify `mario.c` in such a way that it implements this program as described!

== How to Test Your Code

* -1 (or other negative numbers)?
* 0?
* 1 through 8?
* 9 or other positive numbers?
* letters or words?
* no input at all, when you only hit Enter?

== Staff Solution

~cs50/unit1/mario/more
----

== Hints

Try to establish a relationship between (a) the height the user would like the pyramid to be, (b) what row is currently being printed, and (c) how many spaces and how many hashes are in that row. Once you establish the formula, you can translate that to C!

== How to Submit

=== Step 1 of 2

Ensure that `mario.c` is in `~/unit1/mario`, as with:

[source]
----
cd ~/unit1/mario
ls
----

If `mario.c` is not in `~/unit1/mario`, move it into that directory, as via `mv` (or via CS50 IDE's lefthand file browser).

=== Step 2 of 2

* To submit `mario`, execute
+
[source]
----
cd ~/unit1/mario
submit50 cs50/problems/2019/ap/mario/more
----
+

If you run into any trouble, email sysadmins@cs50.harvard.edu!

You may resubmit any problem as many times as you'd like before the deadline.
   
Your submission should be graded for correctness within 2 minutes, at which point your score will appear at https://cs50.me/[cs50.me]

This was Mario.
