= Problem: Pennies

== tl;dr

Implement a program that calculates the sum of getting a doubled amount of money each day for a month, per the below.

[source, subs=quotes]
----
$ [underline]#./pennies#
Days in month: [underline]#30#
Pennies on first day: [underline]#1#
$10737418.23
----

== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along three axes primarily.

Correctness::
  To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?

Design::
  To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?

Style::
  To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

To obtain a passing grade in this course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless granted an exception in writing by the instructor.

== Double or Nothing

If ever given the choice between $10,000,000 or a month's worth of pennies, whereby you receive a penny the first day, two pennies the second, four pennies the third, and so forth... take the penniesfootnote:[By contrast, if you receive an email from some stranger on the Internet offering you an opportunity to double your money, maybe think twice.].

Anyhow, why the pennies? Exponentiation. Those pennies add up Consider how many pennies you'd receive on the 31st day alone, not to mention on the days leading up to it:

[source,bash]
----
1 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
  × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
  × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2

  = 1073741824
----

Put more succinctly, that's 1 × 2^30^. Convert those pennies to dollars (by dividing by 100) and you get, what, over $10,000,000? On just that day? Crazy.

What if you were given more than one penny on that first day? Or the month were February, in which case you'd get shortchanged a few million? (Best to take the pennies in January, March, May, July, August, October, or Decemberfootnote:[We'll admit it. We had to look at a calendar.].) Let's find out.

Implement, in a file called `pennies.c`, a program that first asks the user how many days there are in the month and then asks the user how many pennies he or she will receive on the first day of that month. The program should then calculate the amount that the user will have received **in total** by the end of the month (not just on the last day) if that amount is doubled on every day but the first, expressed not as pennies but as dollars and cents. If the user does not type in 28, 29, 30, or 31 for the number of days in the month, the program should prompt the user to retry. If the user does not input a positive integer for the first day's number of pennies, the program should prompt the user to retry.

For instance, your program might behave as follows, whereby underlined text represents some user's input.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
~/unit1/pennies/ $ [underline]#./pennies#
Days in month: [underline]#32#
Days in month: [underline]#31#
Pennies on first day: [underline]#1#
$21474836.47
----

Notice how this output suggests that the program should indeed re-prompt the user if he or she fails to cooperate with these rules (as by inputting too many days).

How to begin? Well, as before, create a new file inside of your `~/unit1/pennies` directory (remember how?) and name it `pennies.c`. Then, fill the file with some "boilerplate" code like the below:

[source,c]
----
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{

}
----

Save the file and, just to be safe, try compiling it with

[source,bash]
----
make pennies
----

in your terminal window, just to make sure you didn't make any syntactical mistakes, in which case you'll see errors that will need to be fixed! Then dive back into your code.

Odds are you'll want a couple of loops, one with which to prompt (and potentially re-prompt) the user for a number of days, and another with which to prompt (and potentially re-prompt) the user for a number of first-day pennies. How to get both those numbers? Perhaps the CS50 Library offers some options? You may also find functions in the `math.h` header file that can help when working on this problem. Have a look at https://reference.cs50.net/[Reference50] to see which functions those might be. Be sure, if you use any of those functions, to place this line of code near the top of your `pennies.c` file:

[source,c]
----
#include <math.h>
----

Of course, if you store the user's amount due in an `int` (which is only 32 bits), the total will be bounded by (2^31^ - 1) pennies. (Why 2^31^ and not 2^32^? And why 1 less than 2^31^?) Best, then, to store your total in a `long`, so that the user benefits from 64 bits. (Don't worry if users' totals overflow 64 bits and even go negative; consider it punishment for greed!)

Do take care to format the user's total as dollars and cents (to just 2 decimal places), prefixed with a dollar sign, just as we did in the output above. You do not need to insert commas after every 3 digits to the left of the decimal, as you might normally do.

So that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask that your program's last line of output be the amount owed to a user, followed by `\n`. The rest of your program's personality we leave entirely to you!

== Testing

=== Correctness

To test the correctness of your program, you may execute the below at the terminal window.

[source,bash]
----
check50 cs50/problems/2019/ap/pennies
----

=== Style

[source]
----
style50 pennies.c
----

== Staff Solution

And if you'd like to play with the staff's own implementation of `pennies` in CS50 IDE, you may execute the below.

[source,bash]
----
~cs50/unit1/pennies
----

== How to Submit

=== Step 1 of 2

Head back to the ide.cs50.io[CS50 IDE] and ensure that `pennies.c` is in `~/unit1/pennies`, as with:

[source]
----
cd ~/unit1/pennies
ls
----

If `pennies.c` is not in `~/unit1/pennies`, move it into that directory, as via `mv` (or via CS50 IDE's lefthand file browser).

=== Step 2 of 2

* To submit `pennies`, execute
+
[source]
----
cd ~/unit1/pennies
submit50 cs50/problems/2019/ap/pennies
----
+

If you run into any trouble, email sysadmins@cs50.harvard.edu!

You may resubmit any problem as many times as you'd like before the deadline.
   
Your submission should be graded for correctness within 2 minutes, at which point your score will appear at https://cs50.me/[cs50.me]!

This was Pennies.
